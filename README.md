# NutritionQuizApp
This application is a Java-based quiz platform designed to provide an interactive quiz experience. Key features include user authentication, quiz management, and a simple, intuitive graphical interface (GUI).

# About my first project on GitHub
The main purpose of this mini NutritionQuizApp is to serve as a foundational step in my software development journey and to establish a portfolio piece that reflects my growth and commitment to software development. Future enhancements will build on this foundation as I learn new concepts and improve my programming techniques.
